Code for hardware IoT project.
Nowadays in these times of acute water shortage, it is extremely important to hold on to as much water as we can lay our hands on. One of the most valuable ways to gather water is by rainwater harvesting. It's practically free to collect rainwater and can be put to numerous uses once filtered. However, such an important process today is largely disorganized and haphazard. It is also disconnected. Our idea is to bring the system together in one unified and integrated module that is connected to the internet. IoT (Internet of Things) is a very major thing today and will be integral for our project. Our idea:

There'll be a tank connected to a microcontroller board (Arduino or Raspberry Pi). This microcontroller will basically have three devices attached to it - Infrared sensor to measure amount of water, a water contamination and purity tester, and a motor to control the opening and closing of the lid. Now, opening and closing of lid is necessary because if it is open all the time, impurities will gather in it. The sensors will detect rainwater and automatically open the lid. When rain stops, lid will be closed. The other sensors will send data to a Smartphone app that we'll make. It will send relevant data such as amount of rainwater collected, how clean the water is and what percentage of your total water supply is made up of rainwater. The user and community in a particular region will be able to set rain-water collection goals. The overall progress of the goal will be listed and also the app will judge the total amount of rainwater you can collect by analyzing the weather pattern. The government or concerned authorities will be given access to the rainwater collection data for surveys, analyzations and predictions. What's more? The tank will be powered by solar panels.

Rainwater Harvesting is necessary to ensure a steady, safe and free water supply for the future. So now that we streamline and automate the task of water collection, people will be more ready to adapt the new technology as it will be easier for them to use it. Traditional water harvesting methods are laborious and require work from the user's side. It is not easy for the common man to spend hours of their busy lives to use the traditional system. They have to check constantly how clean the water is, how much is collected, etc.

Now that it is automated, people will find it easy to buy and install. So a lot more rainwater will get saved. The will have a lot of environmental impact. Even large institutions can use this automated system and create a larger impact on the environment. Moreover, no electricity will be wasted as it will be completely powered by solar panels, thus furthering the cause of clean energy.
